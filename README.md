# Bubble-Sort
Bubble Sorting Algorithm

📝 Problem Description

    Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    This optimized version stops early if the array becomes sorted.

💡 Approach

    Traverse the array multiple times

    Compare adjacent elements and swap if needed

    Use a swapped flag to detect if any swaps occurred

    If no swaps happen in a pass, the array is already sorted → stop early
